[2025.11.22-11:15]

Restructured technical.md with designator/argument framework. Replaced lvalue/rvalue semantics with designator types (Value, Action, Transformative, Narrative, Structural). Clarified that bare designator names cannot be arguments, only complete designator tags can. Established core asymmetry rule: anything that can be an argument cannot be a designator.

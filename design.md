# HelloRust Design Document

## Overview
An interactive text-based visual novel engine written in Rust. The engine will pull script files from external sources (GitHub or Pastebin) and render them as an interactive narrative experience with player choice mechanics.

## Goals
- Learn Rust syntax and concepts through building a real application
- Explore ownership, borrowing, traits, and pattern matching
- Create a functional text-based visual novel engine
- Support dynamic script loading from remote sources
